        However, only a few of them have been able to make a good impact on society and some are still working hard and serving
        society. Despite being surrounded by all the troubles prevailing in our nation, it is the lack of transparency or the
        rate of corruption.<br>NGOs are more beneficial than government programs because they are usually community based organizations. They research,
        develop and work on several projects which can help people change their lives.</h3>
